            The user plays as an alien whose ship has crashed, in this scenario, Little Saigon,
            a line of Vietnamese-owned businesses along Dorchester Ave in Boston, MA.
            The aliens have lost 6 parts of their ship, and must interact with the locals to
            find them. This comes with a price, you must purchase something from their business.
            During the alien's search, the user learns vocabulary of various common objects from food,
            to glasses, flowers, and more. Each purchase is brought back to the alien's ship mates
            and kept in their inventory. The ship parts are also counted along the journey.
